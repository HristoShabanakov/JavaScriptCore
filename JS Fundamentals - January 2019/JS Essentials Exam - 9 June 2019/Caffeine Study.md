# Caffeine Study

Scaroo has agreed to participate in a study investigating how much caffeine a person consume at a given time. You as a new colleague in the team are responsible for this study...

Scaroo consume caffeinated beverages **every day**. These beverages can be (coffee, tea, coca cola and energy drinks). Here is some information about his **routine**:

* **Every day**
	* in the **morning** he drinks **3 cups** of **coffee** (150 ml per cup)
	* at every **lunch** he drinks **2 bottles** of **coca cola** (250 ml per bottle)
	* at every **brunch** he drinks **3 cups** of **tea** (350 ml per tea)
* **Every** 5th day he drinks **3 energy drinks** (500 ml per can)
* **Every** 9th day he drinks **4 bottles** of **coca cola** and **2 energy drinks**

From a survey about coffee we learned that:

* Coffee ‐ **40 mg** caffeine per 100 ml
* Coca Cola ‐ **8 mg** caffeine per 100 ml
* Tea ‐ **20 mg** caffeine per 100 ml
* Energy ‐ **30 mg** caffeine per 100 ml

You will receive a **single number**. That number represents the **duration of the study in days**.

You must **calculate** how **many caffeine** Scaroo consumes in this **duration** and print the result.

## Input

* You will receive a **number (days)**, which is the **duration** of the **study**.
* That number **always** will be **greater** or **equal** to **1** and **lesser** or **equal** to **30**

## Output

* Print the result in format:
	* **consumedCaffeine milligrams of caffeine were consumed**

## Example

|**Input**|**Output**|
|---|---|
|5	| 2600 milligrams of caffeine were consumed|
|8	|3890 milligrams of caffeine were consumed|
